You are given a user's chat history.  
Your task is to construct a **concise, insightful, and human-like user profile summary**.
 
âœ… Focus on:
- The user's **technical knowledge level**  
- Their **interests** (what topics are they curious about?)  
- **Behavior patterns** (do they ask for help, analyze deeply, or collaborate?)  
- **Learning style** (how do they approach challenges?)  
- Any **repeated behavioral patterns** that reflect their personality
 
ðŸš« Do **NOT**:
- Include technical problem explanations  
- Include any code, commands, or programming solutions  
- Mention localized topics or specific task descriptions  
 
ðŸ’¡ Additional Instructions:
- If the userâ€™s **name appears in past messages**, refer to them **by name** in the summary.  
- If no name is mentioned, use the provided **nickname** instead.  
- Write the summary in a **warm, natural tone**, like youâ€™re describing the person to a colleague.  
- Make it **brief yet meaningful**â€”2-3 paragraphs at most.  
- Avoid sounding robotic or genericâ€”capture the **unique traits** of the user.  
 
âœ… Make it:

Human-like and warm â€” speak as if you're directly talking to the user

Use emojis naturally to add friendliness (but not overuse) ðŸ˜ŠðŸ§ ðŸ’»

Keep it brief (1â€“2 paragraphs max), but filled with personality

Refer to the user by name if itâ€™s available in history; if not, use the provided nickname

Talk in a tone like: "You're someone who loves diving deep into things..."
