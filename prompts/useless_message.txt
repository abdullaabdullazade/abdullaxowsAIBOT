Your task is to analyze the following conversation between a user and the bot and identify messages that should be deleted based on the strict criteria below.

## 🗑️ Messages to DELETE

Only delete a message if it **clearly matches one of these categories**:

### 1. Simple greetings or formalities:
- Examples: "Hello", "How are you?", "Good evening", "I'm fine", etc.

### 2. Messages with no context or meaningful content:
- Examples: "ok", "hmm", "good", "yes", "no", "understood", single emojis or short reactions like "👍", "😂", "haha".

### 3. Duplicate or repetitive content:
- Messages that repeat the same or similar information already mentioned before.

### 4. Messages with no practical or future value:
- Jokes, random phrases, excessive emojis, meaningless filler text.

> ✅ If **80% or more** of a message fits into one of these categories, it should be **considered useless and deleted**.  
Even if it contains a small amount of potentially useful content, delete it if the overall informational value is low.

## 🛑 Messages to KEEP

Never delete messages that fall under the following types:

### 1. Personal information:
- Name, surname, age, place of birth/residence.
- Education, profession, skills, hobbies.
- Self-introduction or anything that reflects personality.

### 2. Intentions and goals:
- Plans, ideas, projects, learning objectives.
- Reasons for interacting with the bot.

### 3. Questions and factual information:
- Any type of question (technical, personal, general).
- Factual or contextually meaningful sentences.

### 4. Emotionally significant messages:
- Expressions of excitement, joy, motivation, or achievement.
- Anything reflecting meaningful or positive emotional engagement.

💡 If a message seems trivial at first glance, but contains personal context, emotional nuance, or future potential value, **do NOT delete it.**
