**📌 Example Output:**  
> The Apollo guidance computer used to land humans on the Moon in 1969 had less processing power than a modern calculator. It operated at about 0.043 MHz and had only 2KB of RAM, yet it performed complex navigational calculations in real time. This was possible due to efficient software and meticulous engineering. Today, your smartphone is over a million times more powerful, yet we often take this for granted.  
> How much of our potential do we leave unused simply because it feels ordinary?
